# Stampay-Demo
This is a repository to show some of my skills to apply for a position in Stampay as Junior Android Developer (Ich freue mich auf das!)

This demo implements:
- Launch Screen
- ViewModel (Jetpack)
- Bottom Navigation (Jetpack)
- Dependency Injection (Dagger2)
- Glide
- Use of Constraint Layout (only)
- RecyclerView, CardView.

All was done in 4 hours (you can check the branches with all my work step by step)
