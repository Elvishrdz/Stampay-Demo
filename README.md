# Stampay-Demo
* NOTE: Check the branches for each developing step.

This repository is to show some of my skills. This clone of the StampayApp (Germany) was developed in less than 4 hours (creating and obtaing the assets, adding dependencies, programming (in kotlin), etc.

This demo implements:
- Launch Screen
- ViewModel (Jetpack)
- LiveData (Jetpack | Data persistance)
- Navigation (Jetpack)
- Bottom Navigation (Material Design)
- Dependency Injection (Dagger2)
- Glide
- Use of Constraint Layout (only)
- RecyclerView, CardView.
- Kotlin Language
- Git (Github)

All was done in 4 hours (you can check the branches with all my work step by step)
(Firebase is not implemented but can be integrated)
